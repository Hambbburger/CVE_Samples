# HALURust Dataset

This repository contains the dataset used in the paper **"HALURust: Exploiting Hallucinations of Large Language Models to Detect Vulnerabilities in Rust"**.

## Overview

The dataset includes various Rust code samples, both vulnerable and non-vulnerable, used to train and evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in detecting security vulnerabilities. This dataset is structured to facilitate the replication of our experiments and to encourage further research in the field of automated vulnerability detection in Rust code.

## Structure

The dataset is organized into the following directories:

- `Positive/`: Contains Rust code samples with known vulnerabilities.
- `Negative/`: Contains Rust code samples without known vulnerabilities.

Each file is named according to the CVE identifier and the CWE type.

## Usage

To use this dataset, clone the repository and navigate to the desired directory:
